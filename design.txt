- the original plan: date, description, usage count
- the excel sheet already sort-of does this easily
  (in fact... Â¿a generic diary app?)
  I just need 1 button! "Add new row"
   + DATE DAY count notes
  Even... could add dates up to today automatically and default to "not shaved"
  on days in between last day + today
  have a popup - incr, new blade, reset
   - would bubble changes through (this is the important bit!)

First run:
   - help, describe how to use the damn thing

DB design - KISS:

date, count, comment

(date should be string remember)
